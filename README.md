## Hi there 👋

I am a BSIT student from Xavier University - Ateneo de Cagayan. To be honest, I'm still figuring out the heavy coding side of things, but I really enjoy the creative part of technology—especially Web Designing. I love seeing how colors, layouts, and fonts come together to make a website look good and easy to use.

🚀 My Journey
- 🏫 School: Currently surviving BSIT at Xavier Ateneo.
- 🎨 Current Love: Exploring UI/UX and making websites look clean and modern.
- 💬 Ask me about: Design inspirations, basic HTML/CSS, or even just tips on how to keep motivated while studying.
- 📬 Email: jmacalaguing@my.xu.edu.ph

🌱 What I'm Trying to Learn
- 🖌️ Web Design & Frontend
- Making things look pretty and responsive with CSS.
- Slowly learning React to add more "life" to my designs.

🏆 Small Wins
- 🎯 Got my Git and GitHub setup working (finally!).
- 💻 Currently working on a API final project and making sure the interface looks nice.
